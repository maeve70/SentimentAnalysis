Learning to use Vader

I had started to use an IFTTT applet (not created by me) back in 2017 to track the tweets of 3 twitter accounts: @realDonaldTrump , @POTUS, @PressSec (if you didn't know, Dan Scavino, former WH Deputy Chief of Staff, was behind the Potus account.) because I wanted to see frequency of tweets, how many tweets based on certain words contained in the tweets etc.

The applet tracked the accounts and put the tweets, and a link to the tweets into a Google Sheet. I had a couple data vizzes in Tableau: Here from 4/1/2017 - 8/1/2019:

and this one is just his tweets from 12/2017 - 2/1/2021

The spreadsheet does include links to the tweets, however, since a certain someone is no longer on Twitter, you cannot see them. And, the other two accounts have been replaced by the current Biden administration personnel. The csv file is a historical record of the tweets at those particular timeframes. The dates for this data set of tweets is 3/14/2017 - 8/10/2018. The csv files are in their own repo.

I wanted to try out Vader. What is below is me learning how to use Vader to analyze the sentiments of the tweets. I'm not sure what I'll find. It's all a learning process & a WIP! :)
